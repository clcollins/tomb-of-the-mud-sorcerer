      evil from times past.  Hundreds have entered and dozens left the tomb
      since it's rediscovery some fourty years ago, leaving the rooms looted and
      vandalized.  Yet, so little as been recovered from the last resting place 
      of the terribe and powerful sorcerer that rumors abound of hidden rooms
      and fabulous wealth still lost and hidden in the tomb.

      So you stand, nervous and excited, before the tomb of the most dangerous
      and powerful man of the last century, ready to seek your fortune at last."

      "The entrance to the Tomb of the Mud Sorcerer is unassuming for one who
      once ruled the better part of the kingdom with an iron fist of terror.
      Dug into the hillside is a small entrance - an opening a head shorter than
      you stand. A rough-cut stone lintel supports the weight of the hill above.
      Nearby lies a broken stone disk that once covered the entrance. A few low
      shrubs and bushes struggle to live in the poor soil.

      The moon waxes large through the thin clouds that smear the sky. It's cold
      light is enough for you to make out details of the scene.

      To one side, quiet, rumbling sounds eminate from behind the leaves of one
      of the larger bushes."

      "You stand in a round, smallish room, musty smelling and damp.  A floor of
      rough-cut stone pavers stretches between walls of small, hand-sized 
      bricks. A low dome ceiling hunches overhead, reminding visitors of the 
      crushing weight of the earthy hillside it supports.

      The walls here were once painted with a wash of white plaster, though 
      much has fallen in the decades since.  You can just make out some 
      disturbing and dark images on the few intact spaces that remain.

      Another small stone door, crowned by a stone lintel, exits across the
      room from the entrance.  Other than a small pile of leaves blown into 
      one corner, the room is empty."

      "Covering what is left of the crumbling plaster, ocre beings alternately
      dance and prostrate themselves before what appears to be a giant.  In 
      places, painted figures are crucified on giant black wheels, and raised 
      to the tops of tall poles.  Hundreds stand planted on the dark hills in
      the background. Elsewhere, frenzied beings flay the skin from the backs of
      others tied to standing triangle frames.

      Above it all, the giant stands.

      Repeated over and over along the top and bottom of the paintings are the
      strange words:

      storyteller suddenly wakes and roars! Dazzling light pours from his eyes
      and mouth and shines from behind the prone figure. A sound like none 
      you've ever heard roars in your ears.

      The storyteller slowly rises from the ground to float above you,arms and
      legs outstretched, with more of the brilliant fire pouring from palms and
      soles.  Around you stones pull free from the earth and rise into the air.
      The ground cracks and splinters and the struggling local flora ignites in
      flame. The noise grows - louder and louder until you feel you can no 
      longer deal with the pain.

      The floating figure gazes upon you, and slowly raises one hand to point
      directly at you. The world is suddenly filled with the light of a
      thousand suns and then..."
